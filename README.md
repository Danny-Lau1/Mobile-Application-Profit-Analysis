# Mobile-Application-Profit-Analysis

## Overview 

As an aspiring data engineer, I am coming to learn the importance of taking data and turing it into something useful to guide business decisions. As a step towards becoming a data engineer, I am learning to use python to take in csv files, clean and organize the data, and prepare an analysis of the data. Another tool I am familiarizing myself with is Jupyter Notebook to run code and markup data as needed.

For this project, I downloaded two datasets from kaggle.com - mobile application data from Apple and Google. These datasets give insight into mobile application downloads from consumers.  The aim of this project was to analyze the data and discover any trends that make an application popular, therefore driving business decisions towards making profitable applications.

## Open The Analysis 
Please open the 'Mobile App Data.ipynb' file above to look at the analysis I have prepared! I have also uploaded the two datasets for Apple and Google applications. I thoroughly enjoyed utilizing python at work to manipulate and clean data.  Please enjoy!
